# Dapr .NET POC

## ðŸ§© Overview
This Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to use the **Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime)** framework with **.NET** to build modern, cloud-native, and event-driven microservices.

Dapr provides a set of portable, language-agnostic building blocks that simplify the development of distributed applications. This project showcases how .NET developers can integrate Dapr to handle **service-to-service calls**, **pub/sub messaging**, **state management**, and **secret/configuration handling** without vendor lock-in.

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Evaluate Daprâ€™s integration with ASP.NET Core microservices.
- Demonstrate inter-service communication via Dapr sidecars.
- Use Dapr building blocks such as:
  - Service Invocation  
  - Publish/Subscribe Messaging  
  - State Management  
  - Secrets Management
- Assess Daprâ€™s developer experience and deployment simplicity.
